### Formal bio

Yu Luo is a Senior Principal Investigator and modeling subject matter expert in the Biopharmaceutical Drug Substance Development department at GSK. He joined GSK in 2021 after completing his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at Columbia University and a postdoctoral position at the University of Delaware.  

During his tenure at GSK, Yu has played a pivotal role in advancing model-based process development, monitoring, and control. He leads a matrix Process Analytical Technology (PAT) team with members from manufacturing and R&D organizations to advance and industrialize Raman spectroscopy for real-time process monitoring and control at both pilot and commercial scales. Additionally, he applied his modeling skills to enhance the productivity of multiple assets. Notably, he introduced the Design of Dynamic Experiments approach to cell culture process development at GSK, enabling the creation of efficient experiments with dynamic inputs. In collaboration with R&D and Global Supply Chain partners, Yu has developed and deployed digital twins for commercial products and late-phase biologics, thereby enhancing the consistency and productivity during the manufacture of commercial products such as Nucala and Jemperli. 

Yu served as an Associate Fellow at GSK and continues to mentor multiple employees, as well as industry-affiliated Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows from various academic institutions. Through these efforts, Yu is advancing scientific innovation both within and outside GSK and nurturing the next generation of talent in bioprocessing.

### What are my core research interests?

My core research interests are data, complex systems, and the human factor under the general theme of decision-making. How to make better decisions is a fundamental question for individuals, organizations, and societies, and there is no easy answer. Systems research, especially [process systems engineering](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/process-systems-engineering/courses-and-seminars/professor-roger-sargent-lecture/rsl-speakers-/) (PSE), with the help of [artificial intelligence](https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aic.16489) (AI), is the approach I'll focus on to tackle some of the decision-making challenges in chemical engineering, biomanufacturing, and society.

| Data | Complex Systems | Human Factor |
| :--------------------: | :--------------------: | :---------------------: |
| ![](images/distill-lite.jpg) | ![](images/brain-lite.jpg) | ![](images/robot2-lite.jpg) |

Data have now become one of the most valuable resources in various industries because of the recent advances in machine learning (ML). Like natural resources, data can be scarce, abundant, or messy, prompting distinct approaches to data-driven decision-making problems. I am interested in employing [optimal experimental design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_design) (OED) methods to generate data efficiently (when data are scarce), extracting information about underlying dynamics and causality from [open data](https://www.data.gov) (when data are abundant), improving data management in biopharmaceutical research (when data are messy), and using hybrid models to develop [explainable artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) (XAI) applications (when data-driven models are opaque).

<!-- We can either explore ways to generate more data (e.g., [optimal experimental design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_design)) or exploit the data we already have (e.g., [open data](https://www.data.gov)). There are many practical challenges to overcome, especially in industries such as biopharmaceuticals, so that we can transform data into knowledge and use data to assist decision-making. Over-reliance on data, on the other hand, has its unintended consequences. Machine learning techniques such as [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) often have little explanatory power given their black-box nature. I am, therefore, also interested in developing [explainable artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) (XAI) methods for chemical engineering. -->

> The problem is not that today’s AI needs to get better at what it does. The problem is that today’s AI needs to try to do something completely different. (Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis, 2019)

Feedback phenomena, networks, and multiple interacting agents are prevalent characteristics of both biological systems (e.g., [metabolism](http://biochemical-pathways.com/#/map/1)) and artificial systems (e.g., chemical processes, social networks). The underlying nonlinearity and uncertainty make these systems challenging to understand, predict, and manage. My research falls into three broad categories: 1) systems biology through [agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) (to understand system dynamics), 2) identification and prevention of [unintended negative consequences](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html) using [process hazard analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_hazard_analysis) (PHA) and data-driven techniques (to predict system behaviors), and 3) biomedical applications based on control theory (to manage system outcomes).

> There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be
foreseen. (Frederic Bastiat, 1850)

<!-- > Because gene drives have the potential to alter an entire species, appropriate regulation of this technology is a major concern ... Any proposed genetic change should be tested to minimize the chances of unintended consequences to the species or the ecosystem. This challenge is particularly daunting for highly mobile species such as the mosquito, which can fly long distances and across national boundaries. (Bruce Conklin, 2019) -->

<!-- Complex networked, multi-agent systems pose many fundamental questions that require long-term studies. For example, the positive benefits of rapid technological developments often come with [unintended negative consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences) to society, such as [ozone depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion), [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change), and [antibiotic resistance crisis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4378521/). Unintended consequences are a crucial topic in sustainability research and are generally difficult to predict. Nonetheless, chemical engineers have practiced the [process hazard analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_hazard_analysis) for a long time to identify potential vulnerabilities in a process system. We see the adoption of this type of "checklist" approach in the public health domain, and I am interested in extending the idea to policymaking and protocol design. -->

In the AI era, it is worth re-considering the role of human decision-making—algorithms should assist, not replace, humans. In my opinion, creating any algorithmic, human-in-the-loop decision-making tool needs to have a basic understanding of human behavior and design such a tool with intentions. Unlike quantifiable objectives in process design, e.g., productivity and product quality, intentions are human-facing and more subtle. I am interested in borrowing the intention-based design principles from industrial and user experience design and developing tools for process monitoring (how to prioritize data visualization), detection and diagnosis (how to diagnose problems like a human operator or [medical doctor](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/ai-versus-md)), and safety (how to prevent runaway situations caused by either [algorithm glitch](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/knight-capital-says-trading-mishap-cost-it-440-million/) or human error).

<!-- In the AI era, it is worth re-considering the role of human decision-making—algorithms should assist, not replace, humans. Creating such human-in-the-loop infrastructures is a design process with the following intentions in mind: effective data visualization, proactive recommendation, and fail-safe mechanism. Unlike quantifiable objectives in process design such as productivity and product quality, intentions are human-facing and more subtle. I am interested in borrowing the intention-based design principles from industrial and user experience design and applying them to monitoring (how to prioritize data visualization given limited attention budget), detection and diagnosis (how to diagnose problems like a human operator or [medical doctor](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/ai-versus-md)), and safety (how to prevent runaway situations caused by either [algorithm glitch](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/knight-capital-says-trading-mishap-cost-it-440-million/) or human error). -->

> Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it's this veneer—that the designers are handed this box and told, "Make it look good!" That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works. (Steve Jobs, 2003)

<!-- The human factor is something we engineers tend to overlook, and yet it plays a vital role in engineering. At the core, it's a discussion about technology and human. I am interested in studying the closed-loop behavior of human decision-making: when we consider the human factor in a complex system, will it destabilize the system? We can use control and game theories to investigate the closed-loop stability of the system, to design efficient and robust mechanisms that consider consumer behaviors and incorporate feedback. We can also actively involve humans in an algorithmic environment, i.e., [human-in-the-loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-in-the-loop) computing. My personal view is that algorithms should assist, not replace, human decision-making. At the same time, algorithms can be too quick, and their internal reasoning can be opaque and biased. Humans can act as a safeguard to reduce the occurrence of runaway situations. We are facing the profound challenge of technology and inequality. The gig economy, for example, has increased the efficiency of meeting demand, but at the same time, it also created new social issues. How do we solve those problems using technology? What are the implications for chemical engineering? -->

### What did I work on as a postdoc?

<!-- I joined GSK as an investigator. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Delaware. --> My research involves the modeling, monitoring, design, and control of cell culture and [glycosylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation) processes in the manufacture of therapeutic [monoclonal antibodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody) (mAbs).

- Ajit Varki: Nothing in glycobiology makes sense, except in the light of evolution ([PDF](files/varki2006nothing.pdf))

### What about my Ph.D.?

My [doctoral thesis](https://doi.org/10.7916/D8FX7G35) is on multi-agent control in [sociotechnical systems](files/1-s2.0-S0098135418308020-main.pdf). I am interested in understanding the collective dynamics of interacting, intelligent individuals in a crowd. From a control theory angle, once we know how opinions and decisions evolve and respond to social feedback, we can design mechanisms that improve the collective decision-making process. In other words, how do we make a crowd ["smarter"](files/08252783.pdf) by providing useful [feedback](files/journal.pone.0150343.PDF)? I have also worked on topics such as [income inequality](files/1-s2.0-S0378437115003738-main.pdf), [opinion dynamics](files/08704276.pdf), and managing [systemic risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_risk) in [finance](files/joi2E20152E242E22E147.pdf), [insurance](files/SSRN-id3008946.pdf), public health, high-frequency trading, and mining safety.

-----

Our research efforts are organized around the general theme of first understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems through mathematical modeling and analysis, and then exploiting this understanding for novel designs and improved operation. The particular complex systems of interest range from polymer reactors, particulate processes and extruders, to biological systems on the cellular, tissue, and organ levels. When sufficient fundamental knowledge is available, we develop and employ dynamic “mechanistic” models; when more data is available than fundamental knowledge, we apply probability theory and statistics for efficient data acquisition and “empirical” model development. Our research group has three main areas of focus.

### Control and System Theory

We are concerned with the development of effective control techniques, with application to industrial polymer reactors, distillation columns, particulate processes, and reactive extrusion processes; we are also interested in reverse engineering biological control systems for process applications.

### Systems Biology

We bring principles of control and systems theory as well as probabilistic/statistical techniques to bear on the analysis of biological processes. We are developing models, tools and techniques to study biological systems across various levels of granularity—from the molecular level where mechanistic details at the genetic and protein levels are studied, to the cellular, tissue, organ and physiological system level. The goals of our systems biology efforts are to be able to understand, analyze and predict integrated biological systems function with sufficient fidelity for potential practical medical and pharmaceutical applications.

### Product Engineering, Process Design and Operations

We employ both stochastic and deterministic technique s for engineering desired characteristics into products, and subsequently for developing inherently robust processes to manufacture these products to meet customer demands consistently in the face of unavoidable process and raw material variations.

<!-- This is the FRONT page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
